# Work-Day-Scheduler

## **Description**

This Work Day Scheduler has been designed to allow the user to enter and save events for a particular time of their day. The date and time will automatically populate at the top of the page and update in real time.  The time blocks are color coordinated to indicate whether the given time/event is in the past, present, or future. Once the events have been recorded & saved, they will remain on the schedule even when the page is refreshed.
